This is a simple Hello World SPA built with TanStack Start.

## Project Structure

This is a minimal TanStack Start application with:
- React 19
- TanStack Router for routing
- CSS Modules for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

## Development

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Run `npm run build` to build for production
- Run `npm run start` to start the production server

The main application logic is in:
- `src/routes/index.tsx` - The home page
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` - The root layout
- `src/router.tsx` - Router configuration

## Complexity Guidelines

**BIAS TOWARD STUPID SIMPLICITY**

Before adding any complexity, you MUST first propose and get approval by analyzing:

### Complexity Analysis Required
For ANY change that adds complexity (new dependencies, patterns, abstractions, configurations):

1. **Benefits**
   - What specific problem does this solve?
   - What value does it add?

2. **Reasoning** 
   - Why is this the simplest solution?
   - What alternatives were considered?

3. **Demerits**
   - What complexity does this introduce?
   - What could go wrong?

4. **Maintainability Impact**
   - How does this affect future changes?
   - Will others understand this easily?

### Examples of Complexity to Avoid
- Unnecessary dependencies
- Over-engineered abstractions
- Premature optimizations
- Complex configurations for unused features
- Multiple ways to do the same thing

### When in Doubt
- Choose the simpler option
- Ask for approval before adding complexity
- Prefer explicit over clever
- Keep it boring and predictable

## Auto-Generated Files

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify or interfere with auto-generated files:**

- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` - Auto-generated by TanStack Router
  - This file is automatically generated and managed by TanStack Router
  - Making manual changes will be overwritten
  - Do not suggest edits, fixes, or modifications to this file
  - Do not format, lint, or analyze this file
  - If there are issues with routing, check the route files in `src/routes/` instead

When working with this project:
- Never suggest changes to `*.gen.ts` files
- Focus on the actual route files in `src/routes/` for routing issues
- Let TanStack Router handle route tree generation automatically
