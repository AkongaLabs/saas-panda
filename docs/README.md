# Documentation ðŸ“š

The stuff you actually need to know to build with this codebase.

## What's here?

**[development.md](./development.md)** - How to get everything running locally without losing your mind

**[ci-cd.md](./ci-cd.md)** - GitHub Actions setup and deployment (when you're ready to ship)

**[security-checklist.md](./security-checklist.md)** - Things to check before you deploy (so you don't get hacked)

**[security-index.md](./security-index.md)** - Security implementation details (the boring but important stuff)

## Project-specific docs

**[../client-panda/README.md](../client-panda/README.md)** - React app details

**[../landing-panda/README.md](../landing-panda/README.md)** - Astro landing page stuff

**[../server-panda/README.md](../server-panda/README.md)** - Express server setup

## If you're new here

1. Start with the main [README.md](../README.md) to understand what this thing is
2. Read [development.md](./development.md) to get your dev environment working
3. When you're ready to deploy, check [security-checklist.md](./security-checklist.md)

## If something's broken

- **Can't get dev server running?** â†’ [development.md](./development.md)
- **Deploy failing?** â†’ [ci-cd.md](./ci-cd.md)  
- **Security concerns?** â†’ [security-index.md](./security-index.md)
- **React app issues?** â†’ [../client-panda/README.md](../client-panda/README.md)

## The philosophy

Documentation should help you ship products, not win documentation contests. Everything here is:

- **Practical** - Actual steps you can follow
- **Current** - Updated when things change
- **Honest** - Admits when things are hard or broken
- **Concise** - Respects your time

If you find outdated info or something doesn't work, fix it. Future you (and everyone else) will thank you.
