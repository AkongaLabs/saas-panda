## üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY COMMANDS**

### **Quick Security Validation**
```bash

cd server-panda && bun audit

# Test security headers
curl -I https://your-app.fly.dev/

# Validate TLS configuration
openssl s_client -connect your-app.fly.dev:443 -servername your-app.fly.dev

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://your-app.fly.dev/api/health; done
```

### **Security Middleware Implementation**
```javascript
// Add to server-panda/src/middleware/index.ts
import { setupSecurityMiddleware } from "./security.js";

export function setupBasicMiddleware(app: Application): void {
  setupSecurityMiddleware(app); // Must be first!
  // ... other middleware
}
```
