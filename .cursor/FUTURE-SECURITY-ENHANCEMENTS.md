# Future Security Stuff ðŸ”’

When you need to add more security features to this app. Most of this is overkill until you have real users and real problems.

## Current Status
Your app has A+ security right now. These are extras for when you actually need them.

## When to Add More Security

### Database Security (Do this when you add a database)
**You'll need this when**: You start storing user data

**What to add:**
- Encrypt database connections (TLS)
- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Set up database user permissions 
- Encrypt backups
- Rotate database passwords automatically

**Time needed**: 1-2 weeks after you add the database
**Why it matters**: Prevents data breaches

---

### User Authentication (Do this when you add login)
**You'll need this when**: Users can create accounts

**What to add:**
- Secure JWT tokens
- Proper password hashing (bcrypt)
- Rate limit login attempts
- Session security (secure cookies)
- Password reset flow
- Optional: 2FA for important accounts

**Time needed**: 2-3 weeks after adding auth
**Packages you'll need**: `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `passport`

---

### Better Input Validation (Do this when you have forms)
**You'll need this when**: Users can submit data

**What to add:**
- Validate all user inputs
- File upload security (size limits, type checking)
- Prevent XSS attacks
- CSRF protection for forms
- Sanitize data before saving

**Time needed**: 1 week after adding forms

---

## Nice-to-Have Security (For Later)

### Security Monitoring
**Add when**: You have >1000 daily users

**What it does**: Tells you when bad stuff happens
- Alert when someone's trying to hack you
- Track failed login attempts
- Monitor unusual traffic patterns
- Log security events

**Tools to consider**: Prometheus + Grafana, or just good logging

---

### API Security
**Add when**: Your API gets >10,000 calls per day

**What to add:**
- API keys for different users
- OAuth if you need it
- Better rate limiting per user
- Audit logs for API usage

---

### Infrastructure Security  
**Add when**: You have multiple servers or services

**What to add:**
- Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
- Use a proper secrets manager (not just .env files)
- VPN for admin access
- Regular security checkups

---

## Compliance Stuff (Probably Overkill)

### GDPR, SOC 2, etc.
**Add when**: You're selling to enterprises or in regulated industries

**What it involves:**
- GDPR compliance (if you have EU users)
- SOC 2 (if enterprises ask for it)
- PCI DSS (if you handle credit cards)
- Data retention policies

**Time needed**: 6+ months and probably outside help
**When to worry**: When customers actually ask for it

---

## How to Decide What to Add

### Add immediately when:
- You add a database â†’ Database security
- You add user accounts â†’ Authentication security  
- You add forms â†’ Input validation

### Add when you grow:
- 1000+ users â†’ Security monitoring
- 10,000+ API calls/day â†’ API security
- Multiple services â†’ Infrastructure security

### Add when business needs it:
- Enterprise customers â†’ Compliance stuff
- High traffic â†’ DDoS protection
- Big team â†’ Automated security testing

## Don't Overthink It

**Focus on what's likely to hurt you:**
1. Database breaches (secure your data)
2. Brute force attacks (rate limiting)
3. Basic injection attacks (input validation)

**Don't obsess over:**
1. Perfect security scores from automated tools
2. Theoretical attacks that need physical access
3. Zero-day exploits (just keep dependencies updated)

## When Something Goes Wrong

**If you get hacked:**
1. Take the app offline
2. Change all passwords and API keys
3. Figure out how they got in
4. Fix the hole
5. Deploy with new secrets

**If performance is bad:**
1. Check if you're getting DDoSed
2. Look at database connection limits
3. Check for memory leaks

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check your security headers
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..20}; do curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health; done

# Check for vulnerabilities
bun audit

# See production secrets
fly secrets list
```

## The Bottom Line

Your current security is good enough for most apps. Add more security when you have actual users and actual problems to solve.

Security is about being practical, not paranoid. Focus on the basics that prevent real attacks, not theoretical ones.
